(I remember).
Good girl, sad boy. Big city, wrong choices.
We had one thing going on.
I swear that it was something.
'Cause I don't remember who I was before you.
Painted all my nights.
A color I have searched for since.
But one thing after another.
Fuckin' situations, circumstances.
Miscommunications and I.
Have to say.
By the way.
I just may like some explanations.
Can I ask you a question?
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room.
And every single one of your friends was making fun of you.
But fifteen seconds later they were clapping too?
Then what did you do?
Did you leave her house in the middle of the night? Oh.
Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight, oh.
When she said it was too much?
Do you wish you could still touch her?
It's just a question.
Half-moon eyes, bad surprise.
Did you realize out of time?
She was on your mind.
With some dickhead guy.
That you saw that night.
But you were on something.
It was one drink after another.
Fuckin' politics and gender roles.
And you're not sure and I don't know.
Got swept away in the gray.
I just may like to have a conversation.
Can I ask you a question?
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room.
And every single one of your friends was making fun of you.
But fifteen seconds later they were clapping too?
Then what did you do?
Did you leave her house in the middle of the night? Oh.
Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight, oh.
When she said it was too much?
Do you wish you could still touch her?
It's just a question.
Does it feel like everything's just like second best after that meteor strike?
And what's that that I heard, that you're still with her?
That's nice, I'm sure that's what's suitable.
And right.
But tonight.
Can I ask you a question? (Can I ask you a question?).
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room? (In a crowded room).
And every single one of your friends was making fun of you (You, making fun of you).
But fifteen seconds later they were clapping too?
Then what did you do?
Did you leave her house in the middle of the night? Oh.
Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight, oh.
When she said it was too much?
Do you wish you could still touch her?
It's just a question.
